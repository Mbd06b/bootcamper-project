var forgottenItemNum = 2;
//STEP 1:
//Write an if else statment to see the number given in range of the list and is not zero


//STEP 2:
//In the else block print out "Hey! that number is too large"

//STEP 3:
//In the true block write a switch statement that goes through 1-5 and prints out a grocery item.
