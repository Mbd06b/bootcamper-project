	  <div><h1>Java Bootcamp Companion Project </h1></div>
	  <div><h2>Introduction - Read Me</h2></div>
	  <div>
		  <p>The bootcamp project is a basic java webapp, Using SpringMVC, AngularJS, managed by Maven, and run with a Jetty plugin. Persistence mocked by a static collection.</p>
		  <p>A full introduction on standing up a project like this can be found here: <a href="http://websystique.com/springmvc/spring-mvc-4-restful-web-services-crud-example-resttemplate/">Spring MVC 4 RESTFul Web Services CRUD Example</a></p>
		  <p>This architecture was chosen for its simplicity to introduce those new to Java web applications to a very simple web app and was built by someone completely new to Java.</p>
		  <p>The 'review' branch is a solution branch, which provides a more standards-compliant view of the same project.</p>
		  <p>As bootcampers progress through the bootcamp they:</p>
		  <div>
		  	<ul>
		  		<li>Fork the Project - <a href="https://github.com/Mbd06b/bootcamper-project">https://github.com/Mbd06b/bootcamper-project</a></li>
		  		<li>Clean the code of non-conforming Java</li>
		  		<li>Implement a DAO by moving the static list out of the Service, and finishing CRUD methods either with loops or streams to interact with the list.</li>
		  		<li>TBD</li>
		  	</ul>	
		  </div>
		  <p>It's important to note that bootcampers are going to have wide experiences with the project. Those learning Java, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript from scratch should spend more time drilling the languages, and use this as an aspirational example to guide their learning, while experienced bootcampers could completely reform the project to demonstrate what they are ready to do.</p>
		  
		  <h2>Day 1 - Project Group Workspace Setup</h2>
		  <p>In order to help troubleshoot and collaborate as a team during the bootcamp, after our first meeting, we standup a common Java web application local developer environment together.  Walking through a common setup using the Eclipse IDE will allow us to expedite introductory modules common to many online Java courses, and introduce some common environment technologies like Maven.</p>

		  <table>
		  	<tr>
		  		<td>
		  			<p><strong>Java JDK 8 (Wait to Install)</strong></p>

		   <h2>Project Tasks</h2>
		  <p>With the Environment that we setup together on your local machine you are going to perform “Project Tasks” alongside select Pluralsight modules which provide opportunities to demonstrate your current skill and progression throughout of the bootcamp.</p>

		  <h3>Task 1.0 - Learning Naming Conventions</h3>
		  <p>As an easy first task, and as an exploration of the the codebase of the project, refactor the Object, Package, and Variable names in the project to match standard Java conventions.</p>
		  <p></p>
		  <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-contents.html" target="_blank">Java Conventions Reference</a>
		  <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-namingconventions.html" target="_blank">Java Naming Conventions</a>
		  <p><strong>Acceptance Criteria:</strong> Java project should still successfully compile, and the server launches.</p>
		  
		   <h3>Task 2.0 - Create a MockDAO, Separate Concerns, and Repair Web Components</h3>
		   <p>The Service of our application, also contains our data, tightly couples our business-logic layer with our data, this isn't good.</p>
		   <p>The web application at the moment can only Read and Create games.</p>
		   <p>Uh Oh! By refactoring the objects and variables in our Java application, we changed the key names of the properties of our Javascript objects (JSON).</p>
			
		   <ol>
			   <li>Create a MockDAO Class, and lift the static List declaration of our data from the Service into the MockDAO.</li>	   
			   <li>Since we need to Update and Delete games, add update and delete methods to the Service and connect those to corresponding methods in the MockDAO. Use loops and access properties to update the list. If you are skillful with loops and lists, consider using the Java streams API.</li>
			   <li>Repair what we broke in our webapp by updating the JavaScript variables in our views.</li>
		   </ol>
		   <p><strong>Acceptance Criteria:</strong> The  project should compile, launch, AND you should be able to add a game (again) to the list in the UI of the running application</p>


		   <h3>Task 2.1 - Discover Interfaces as an introduction to APIs</h3>
		   <p>Application Programming Interfaces, or API's are software intermediaries that allows two applications to talk to each other. Within Java itself, Interface objects, function similarly to an API by exploiting Object's inheritance of interface methods.</p>
		   <p>Create Interfaces for the Model, DAO, and Service objects in the Java Application.</p> 
		   
		   <h3>Task 3.0 - Complete the Feature</h3>
		   <p>Now that we have prepared the service and DAO with our CRUD methods, we need to complete the feature.</p>
		   <p>Add to the view to update an existing record, and delete an existing record.</p>
		   <p>If you have time, add an select control that allows you to filter the records list by genre.</p>
		   <strong>Acceptance Criteria:</strong> Successfully demo the CRUD feature of the running application.
