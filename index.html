	  <div><h2>Introduction - Read Me</h2></div>
	  <div>
		  <p>The bootcamp project is a basic java webapp, Using SpringMVC, AngularJS, managed by Maven, and run with a Jetty plugin. Persistence mocked by a static collection.</p>
		  <p>A full introduction on standing up a project like this can be found here: <a href="http://websystique.com/springmvc/spring-mvc-4-restful-web-services-crud-example-resttemplate/">Spring MVC 4 RESTFul Web Services CRUD Example</a></p>
		  <p>This architecture was chosen for its simplicity to introduce those new to Java web applications to a very simple web app and was built by someone completely new to Java.</p>
		  <p>The 'review' branch is a solution branch, which provides a more standards-compliant view of the same project.</p>
		  <p>As bootcampers progress through the bootcamp they:</p>
		  <div>
		  	<ul>
		  		<li>Fork the Project - <a href="https://github.com/Mbd06b/bootcamper-project">https://github.com/Mbd06b/bootcamper-project</a></li>
		  		<li>Clean the code of non-conforming Java</li>
		  		<li>Implement a DAO by moving the static list out of the Service, and finishing CRUD methods either with loops or streams to interact with the list.</li>
		  		<li>TBD</li>
		  	</ul>	
		  </div>
		  <p>It's important to note that bootcampers are going to have wide experiences with the project. Those learning Java, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript from scratch should spend more time drilling the languages, and use this as an aspirational example to guide their learning, while experienced bootcampers could completely reform the project to demonstrate what they are ready to do.</p>
		  
		  <h2>Day 1 - Project Group Workspace Setup</h2>
		  <p>In order to help troubleshoot and collaborate as a team during the bootcamp, after our first meeting, we standup a common Java web application local developer environment together.  Walking through a common setup using the Eclipse IDE will allow us to expedite introductory modules common to many online Java courses, and introduce some common environment technologies like Maven.</p>
