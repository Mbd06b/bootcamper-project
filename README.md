The java bootcamp project is a basic java webapp,  Using SpringMVC, AngularJS, managed by Maven, and run with a Jetty plugin. Persistence mocked by a static collection.

A full introduction on standing up a project like this can be found here Spring MVC 4 RESTFul Web Services CRUD Example:  http://websystique.com/springmvc/spring-mvc-4-restful-web-services-crud-example-resttemplate/


This architecture was chosen for it's simplicity to introduce those new to Java web applications to a very simple web app and was built by someone completely new to Java. 

The 'mgl-webapp' module is the starting module full of issues for the bootcamper to clean, fix, and upgrade. 

The 'mgl-webapp_review' module is the completed solution module, which provides a more standards-compliant view of the same project, with a completed CRUD feature, and implemented unit tests. 

As bootcampers progress through the bootcamp they:
* Fork the Project
* Clean the code of non-conforming Java
* Implement a DAO by moving the static list out of the Service, and finishing CRUD methods either with loops or streams to interact with the list. 
* Use HTML, JS, and Java, connected to the Java Service in the prior task to complete the basic CRUD feature of the games list. 

It's important to note that bootcampers are going to have wide experiences with the project. Those learning Java, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript from scratch should spend more time drilling the languages, and use this as an aspirational example to guide their learning, while experienced bootcampers could completely reform the project to demonstrate what they are ready to do.
